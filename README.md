This project is a CPU Scheduling simulator that simulates a CPU scheduler. Using different scheduling methods like FCFS, SJF, Round Robin Scheduling and others to schedule processes
This project was done by Qudus Adewale. Student number 21903301.

These are the current working Scheduling Methods:
First Come First Served - Non Preemptive
First Come First Served - Preemptive
Shortest Job First - Non Preemptive
Priority Scheduling - Non Preemptive
Round Robin Scheduling - Non Preemptive
Round Robin Scheduling - Preemptive

There is currently a bug that glitches outt he program if you try run any scheduling method after SJF. Hopefully it would be fixed before my final submission
